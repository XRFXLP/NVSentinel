/*
IsNodeDrained returns if the given node is drained based on the current status of HealthEvents. The HealthEvent ID
is extracted from each event prior to looking up the current drain status for each event. If any event reports a
drain status of Succeeded, or AlreadyDrained without DrainOverrides.Skip, and if that HealthEvent covers
currentPartialEntity, then we consider the node drained. An AlreadyDrained status caused by DrainOverrides.Skip does
not count as proof of a completed drain since no pods were actually evicted for that event. Note that if
currentPartialEntity is nil, we require a full drain and if currentPartialEntity is non-nil, we require either a
full drain or a partial drain for the same partialDrainEntity. This function is used in 2 contexts:

1. Determining if a new event in node-drainer can be marked as AlreadyDrained (with support for partial or full drains)
- The excludeEventID is set to the new event so that we don't unnecessarily look its drain status
- The list of HealthEvents are sourced from the quarantineHealthEvent annotation
- If the current event has a partialDrainEntity, we support skipping the drain for either full drains or partial
drains targeting the same partialDrainEntity. If the current event has no partialDrainEntity, we require a full drain.

2. Determining if any event as part of a quarantine session completed a full drain
- The excludeEventID is not set because there is no notion of a current event to ignore
- The list of HealthEvents are sourced from the quarantineValidationHealthEvent annotation which persists unhealthy
events from the quarantine session that require post-remediation validation even if they recover and are removed from
the related quarantineHealthEvent annotation.
- We will always pass no currentPartialEntity, and getPartialDrainEntity is PartialDrainEntity (below), so an event
only counts as proof of a full drain if it did not itself qualify for a partial drain — an event that would have
qualified for a partial drain never proves the rest of the node was evicted.
